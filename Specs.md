# Project Specifications: English Speaking Fluency Analyzer

## Overview
The goal of this project is to create an **English Speaking Fluency Analyzer** that evaluates and provides actionable feedback on a user's fluency in spoken English. The focus is on fluency-related metrics such as **speech rate**, **pauses/hesitations**, and **coherence**. This tool will help users improve their ability to communicate effectively and confidently in English.

The project has been pivoted from public speaking to general English speaking based on expert recommendations (e.g., Sir Dennis) and feasibility within a three-week timeline. The scope is narrowed to fluency to ensure simplicity and practicality. Insights from resources like the **[IELTS Speaking Band Descriptors](https://ieltstutors.org/speaking-band-descriptors/#descriptors)** and the **[CEFR Levels]( https://www.coe.int/en/web/common-european-framework-reference-languages/level-descriptions )** guide the evaluation criteria.

## Key Features
1. **Speech Rate Analysis**:
   - Measures the number of words spoken per minute (WPM).
   - Provides feedback on whether the pace is too slow, optimal, or too fast.
2. **Pause and Hesitation Detection**:
   - Tracks the frequency and duration of pauses and filler words (e.g., "um," "uh").
   - Offers suggestions to reduce hesitations for smoother speech.
3. **Coherence Evaluation**:
   - Analyzes the logical flow of ideas using linking words (e.g., "because," "however").
   - Provides feedback on improving coherence and topic transitions.
4. **Color-Coded Feedback**:
   - Uses a red-yellow-green spectrum to visually indicate fluency levels:
     - **Red**: Low fluency (frequent hesitations, slow pace).
     - **Yellow**: Moderate fluency (some hesitations, average pace).
     - **Green**: High fluency (smooth, effortless speech).
5. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Provides tips like "Try reducing long pauses" or "Use linking words to connect ideas."
6. **Scoring System**:
   - Maps fluency metrics to CEFR levels (A1â€“C2) for a standardized proficiency assessment.

## Tech Stack
Below is the recommended tech stack for building the English Speaking Fluency Analyzer:

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js  
  - Why: React is lightweight, component-based, and ideal for creating dynamic, interactive UIs.
  - Libraries:
    - `react-chartjs-2`: For visualizing fluency metrics (e.g., speech rate, pause frequency).
    - `react-speech-recognition`: For capturing microphone input and converting speech to text.
    - `framer-motion`: For smooth animations (e.g., color transitions for feedback).
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern design.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Python (FastAPI)  
  - Why: FastAPI is lightweight, supports asynchronous operations, and integrates seamlessly with machine learning models.
  - Libraries:
    - `librosa`: For extracting audio features like pitch, pauses, and speech rate.
    - `SpeechRecognition`: For processing raw audio input.
    - `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow`: For analyzing fluency metrics and generating scores.
  - API Endpoints:
    - `/analyze-fluency`: Accepts audio data and returns fluency metrics and feedback.

### Machine Learning Models
- **Speech-to-Text**:
  - Use pre-trained models like **[Whisper](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large )** from Hugging Face for accurate transcription.
- **Fluency Analysis**:
  - Train a custom model or use existing NLP models to detect coherence (e.g., linking words) and filler words.
  - Example: **[BERT-based models](https://huggingface.co/models )** for coherence analysis.

### Database
- **Option 1**: PostgreSQL  
  - Why: Reliable and scalable for structured data (e.g., user profiles, fluency scores).
- **Option 2**: Firebase  
  - Why: Ideal for real-time updates and gamification features (e.g., progress tracking).

### Deployment
- **Frontend**: Host on **Vercel** or **Netlify** for static hosting.
- **Backend**: Deploy on **Heroku** or **AWS Lambda** for scalability.
- **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

## How It Works Together
### Workflow
1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user speaks into the app's microphone interface.
   - The frontend captures audio input and sends it to the backend via an API call.
2. **Audio Processing**:
   - The backend processes the audio using libraries like `librosa` to extract fluency metrics (e.g., speech rate, pauses).
   - Speech-to-text conversion is performed using the **Whisper** model from Hugging Face.
3. **Fluency Analysis**:
   - A custom model or NLP pipeline analyzes the text for coherence (e.g., linking words) and detects filler words.
   - Metrics are mapped to a scoring system (e.g., CEFR levels).
4. **Feedback Generation**:
   - The backend generates feedback (e.g., "Reduce long pauses") and assigns a fluency score.
   - Results are sent back to the frontend in JSON format.
5. **Visualization**:
   - The frontend displays the results using charts, graphs, and color-coded indicators.
   - Real-time feedback is provided through animations (e.g., color transitions).
